# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
Analyze the data and provide visualizations to give Louise clear insights into the campaign trends and find out if their outcomes were affected by their launch date and/or fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
The full analysis and workbook can be found here: [Kickstarter Analysis](Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

First, I filtered the data solely for the theater parent category and created a line chart to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month, as shown below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next, I created a line chart to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount, as shown below.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May is the best month to launch a theater Kickstarter campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

### Recommendations for Louise:

* Since a higher number of successful kickstarter campaigns were launched in May (see Outcomes based on Launch Date chart above), I recommend Louise launch her kickstarter in May.

* Even though the Theater subcategory has a high proportion of successful kickstarter campaigns compared to other subcategories (see Parent Category Outcomes chart above), which is great news for Louise, it's clear from the data that she should try to get her theater project produced for less than her $12,000 goal, if possible. She should try to keep her fundraising goal to around $5,000-$5,500 for a greater chance for success.
